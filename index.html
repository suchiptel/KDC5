<h1>A Great Friend</h1>
<p>SDuring Shantilal's early childhood, father Motibhai went to work in a village called Rajnagar in the district of Savli. Shantilal was also with his father. Young Shantilal would play various children's games with his friends. On the outskirts of the village, they would often celebrate and enjoy eating mangoes together at the river banks. Whose childhood was ever spent without quarrels or fights? Shantilal, however, was not at all touched by these influences despite his age. "From the beginning, I did not like to ever argue with anyone, nor did I ever like to see others arguing. It would pain me, and I would wonder why people argued. Even if there was reason for conflict, still I would not argue, merely tolerate. I would behave in such a way that the need for quarrel never arose. In fact, I would become scared if others quarrelled, sometimes even cry if I saw others fighting." His lifestyle was such that he was amicable to all.
