<h1>A Great Friend</h1>
<p>Shantilal possessed the ornaments of both spirituality and studies. As a child, young Shantilal excelled in his studies. When he began studying in Padra, a village 6 km from Chansad, he would insist on getting there early. He was a brilliant student, coming top or second in his class; even in daily attendance!  He diligently revised his daily lessons at home on the same day, often studying with Chunilal until 1.30 am. During exams, he thoroughly prepared and hence had no fear. His impeccable behaviour, quiet, disciplined and orderly nature inspired his peers.</p>
